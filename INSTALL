=== Configuration

You should have something like this in config/initializers/crashlog.rb.

  CrashLog.configure do |config|
    config.api_key    = 'AhHusJhJHAjJajA'
    config.project_id = 'ca9e5931-310f-4897-90c2-d0626f0f2a01'
  end

(Please note that this configuration should be in a global configuration, and
is *not* environment-specific. CrashLog is smart enough to know what errors are
caused by what environments, so your staging errors don't get mixed in with
your production errors.)

You can test that CrashLog is working in your production environment by using
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake crashlog:test

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to CrashLog
which will be visible immediately.
